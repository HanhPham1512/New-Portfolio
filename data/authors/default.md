My name is Hannah Pham, and I am a skilled and results-driven data analyst with a strong background in marketing. I have acquired my data analyst skills through various platforms such as Udacity, DataCamp, 365 Data, Codecademy, and LinkedIn Learning. I bring an open-minded and can-do attitude to support businesses with high productivity.

Throughout my career, I have been involved in numerous projects and gained valuable experience working with different companies. My projects have consistently been highly regarded, leading to a 30-35% increase in decision-making efficiency. Additionally, I possess a strong marketing background from my previous role as a Marketing Specialist in Vietnam.

I am dedicated, driven, and have a proven track record of delivering results. I am confident in my ability to make a positive impact on your organization's success. I am excited about the possibility of contributing my skills and experience to your team and look forward to discussing how I can add value in further detail.
